# Structure visualization via UMAP embedding of MCES distances

This repository contains datasets from the Paper [Small molecule machine learning: All models are
wrong, some may not even be helpful](https://doi) alongside Jupyter Notebooks for visualization of
MCES distances. Files too large for GitHub are hosted at [OSF](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5SXFE).

## Visualization

Visualization of precomputed UMAP embeddings as well as for new structures can be performed with the notebook [display_umap.ipynb](display_umap.ipynb).
To project MCES distances of a new dataset onto the existing UMAP embedding, use [umap_embedding.ipynb](umap_embedding.ipynb).

Python packages required are:
```
umap-learn
numba=0.53.1
pandas
numpy
plotly
rdkit
dash
jupyter-dash
```

A conda (or [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)) environment with all necessary packages installed can be created with
```bash
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
# to activate:
conda activate umap_mces
```

## Docker

For deployment behind a reverse proxy, use the environment variables `PROXY_PREFIX_REQUESTS`, `PROXY_PREFIX_ROUTES` and `PROXY_PREFIX_URL` with the docker run option `docker run -e PROXY_PREFIX='mysite.com/' ...`.
